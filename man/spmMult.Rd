\title{spmMult - calculates the dynamics using a Schaefer or Fox model}
\usage{
spmMult(inp, indat, schaefer = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{inp}{a vector of 2 or 3 model parameters (r,K) or (r,K,Binit), you
would use the latter if it was suspected that the fishery data started
after some initial depletion had occurred.}

\item{indat}{a matrix with at least columns 'year', 'catch', and 'cpue'}

\item{schaefer}{a logical value determining whether the spm is to be a
simple Schaefer model (p=1) or approximately a Fox model (p=1e-08). The
default is TRUE}
}
\value{
a list of five objects; outmat the matrix with the dynamics results,
    q catchability, msy the maximum sustainable yield, the parameter values,
    and sumout, which contains r, K, B0, msy, p, q, Depl, FinalB, and InitDepl
}
\description{
spmMult calculates the dynamics using a Schaefer of Fox model.
    The outputs include  predicted Biomass, year, catch, cpue, predicted
    cpue, contributions to q, ssq, and depletion levels. Generally it
    would be more sensible to use simpspm when fitting a Schaefer model and
    simpfox when fitting a Fox model
    as those functions are designed to generate only the predicted cpue
    required by the functions ssq and negLLM, but the example shows how it
    could be used. the function spm is used inside 'plotModel'
    and could be used alone, to generate a fullist of model outputs
    after the model has been fitted.
